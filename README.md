# Password Generator

This Java program generates a random password based on the specified length. It includes at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one special character, and one number.

Usage:
Compile the `PasswordGenerator.java` file:
```bash
javac PasswordGenerator.java 

1. Run the compiled file:
java PasswordGenerator

Enter the desired length for the password when prompted. The program will generate a random password and display it. You can copy the generated password and use it as needed.

Note: Make sure to handle the password securely, as it is randomly generated and cannot be recovered once generated.
